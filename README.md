# Linear-Equation-with-SuperLU

The main purpose of this code it to efficiently solve Ax=B linear equation, and which A is a sparse matrix. The program reads A from file and the format of A is Harwell-Boeing.

To manipulate matrix more conveniently, i used Egien library here.

The details and results in this project are included in the PDF "final report.pdf". Feel free to have a look.
